# Times-Series-1
In this project, the data concerns coal-fired power generation in the USA, over the period 2001-2022.  The aim is to unravel the complex patterns hidden in this time-series data.

Here are the steps to follow:
- Show the trend of the series, using a moving average filter and the regression curve of annual averages.
- Calculate and plot the seasonal coefficients and give the decomposition of the series.
- Plot and comment on the seasonally-adjusted series, then plot and comment on the boxplots of the residuals.
- Make a forecast of electricity production for the year 2023, using three different methods.
- Repeat the three forecasting methods for the year 2022, using data from 2001 to 2021.
Calculate the root-mean-square forecast error for each of the three methods.
